[Jenkins]
The error "workspace already in use" usually means another build is holding a lock. Use the "Wipe out current workspace" option and re-trigger the build.
If you see "channel is already closed", it often means an agent lost connection. Restart the agent or remove offline nodes.

[Kubernetes]
"CrashLoopBackOff" is typically due to application errors or misconfiguration. Run `kubectl logs <pod>` to get logs and debug further.
"ImagePullBackOff" errors usually indicate incorrect image name or registry access issues. Verify your image and credentials.
If a pod stays in "Pending" state, it might be due to insufficient node resources or missing persistent volumes.

[Docker]
If you get "no space left on device", clean up unused containers/images with `docker system prune`.
For "permission denied" errors on `docker-compose up`, check if the user is in the `docker` group or try running with `sudo`.

[Helm]
If you encounter "cannot patch resource" during `helm upgrade`, it's often safer to run `helm uninstall` followed by a clean `helm install`.
If you get "no deployed releases", it means no release with that name exists in the namespace. Check with `helm list -n <namespace>`.

[Terraform]
A common issue is "Error locking state file". This usually means another process is running `terraform apply`. Wait or unlock manually via the backend.
"Cycle in resource dependency" errors indicate circular dependencies. Use `depends_on` carefully to break the cycle.

[Nexus]
When deploying to Nexus, "403 Forbidden" usually indicates permission or role issues. Check user roles for `nx-deploy`.
"Invalid checksum" means the file content changed after upload started. Re-upload the file using a fresh connection.

[SonarQube]
"Unable to register sensor" usually means a version mismatch between SonarScanner and SonarQube server.
"Quality Gate failed" indicates the code did not meet minimum coverage or maintainability thresholds. Review your analysis report.

[GitHub Actions]
A job stuck in "queued" status for long durations might mean no available runner is assigned. Check your runner pool or `runs-on` label.
Secrets must be defined in repository settings. A missing secret will cause the step to fail silently.

[Prometheus]
"Context deadline exceeded" in Prometheus scrapes means the target was unreachable or slow to respond. Check service/network latency.
Memory usage in Prometheus can grow significantly with high cardinality metrics. Use labels carefully.

[ArgoCD]
"Resource not found" errors in sync operations often mean a mismatch between declared and actual namespace. Ensure
